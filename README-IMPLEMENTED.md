# README-IMPLEMENTED.md

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of various software engineering principles and practices to enhance the functionality and maintainability of a customer management system. The key areas of focus include:

1. Refactoring for SOLID Design Principles
2. Intelligent Field Validation
3. RESTful API Endpoints
4. Dynamic UI Updates
5. Unit Testing
6. Security and High-Quality API Endpoint Design

## 1. Refactoring for SOLID Design Principles
The codebase was refactored to adhere to the SOLID design principles:
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a single responsibility.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Classes are open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Subclasses can replace their base classes without affecting the functionality.
- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Clients are not forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules; both depend on abstractions.

## 2. Intelligent Field Validation
Implemented intelligent validation for form fields and API inputs:
- **Postal Code/ZIP Validation**: Ensures that the ZIP code matches the expected format based on the provided US State.
- **Dynamic Validation Rules**: Validation rules are dynamically applied based on the context of the input.

## 3. RESTful API Endpoints
Developed RESTful API endpoints for customer management:
- **Create Customer**: `POST /api/v1/customers`
- **Read Customer by ID**: `GET /api/v1/customers/{id}`
- **Read All Customers**: `GET /api/v1/customers`
- **Update Customer**: `PUT /api/v1/customers/{id}`
- **Delete Customer**: `DELETE /api/v1/customers/{id}`

## 4. Dynamic UI Updates
Implemented dynamic updates to the UI:
- **Customer Dropdown List**: Automatically updates when customers are added, updated, or deleted.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Provides immediate feedback to users on form submissions and actions.

## 5. Unit Testing
Added unit tests to ensure the reliability of the code:
- **Field Validation Tests**: Tests for various validation rules.
- **API Endpoint Tests**: Tests for all CRUD operations on the customer API.

## 6. Security and High-Quality API Endpoint Design
Enhanced security and quality of the API endpoints:
- **Authentication**: Implemented user authentication to secure endpoints.
- **Authorization**: Ensured that only authorized users can perform certain actions.
- **Input Validation**: Validated all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.
- **Error Handling**: Provided comprehensive error handling to return meaningful error messages.
- **HTTP Enforcement**: Enforced the use of HTTPS for secure communication.
- **CORS Policy**: Configured CORS policy to control access from different origins.
- **API Versioning**: Implemented versioning to manage changes to the API.
- **Logging**: Added logging to track API usage and errors.

## Additional Notes
- **In-Memory Database**: Used an in-memory database for simplicity and ease of testing.
- **Configuration**: Pay attention to UI and API ports in the configurations and code.
- **Token Generation**: Used `GenerateToken()` instead of logging in the user to simulate authentication and obtain the token.
- **JWT Security**: Utilized JWT (JSON Web Token) for enhanced security.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the application of best practices in software development, focusing on maintainability, security, and user experience. The refactoring and enhancements ensure that the system is robust, scalable, and secure.
